        My name is Kemigisa Lailah Grant. I'm a female muslim Ugandan woman which means I come from Uganda(The Pearl of Africa). I'm from a humble home that I thank Allah for daily. I really love learning new things and inspire many people more so the ladies. I want to master the art of working, associating and contributing to the team and general public.
